<h3 align="center">Game Recommendation System</h3>

  <p align="center">
    School project to create a program that recommends video games based on user input using a machine learning algorithm.
    <br />



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This program required cleaning and preparing data about games on the Steam store (obtained May 2019) and then using that data to create a program that would recommend similar games to a user based on their chosen input game. KMeans clustering from Scikit-Learn's library is applied
to the data and then euclidean distance is used to determine how similar one game is to another based on boolean verticies containing information on each assigned 'tag' each game has. The program was developed using Jupyter Notebooks and uses that interface for its visual elements.

The data used was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games
